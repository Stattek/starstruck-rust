# Starstruck
- Starstruck is a game that I first built in C++ when I was in 8th grade as part of a project for my english class (of all things).
    - It became pretty good for what I had known at the time, and I was very happy with how it turned out.
    - However, it used a lot of stolen sounds and music.

- This is a re-envisioning of that game but in Rust. Hopefully with some new features, as well.

## Future
- Want to get a terminal UI working. I want to be able to play the game through a UI instead of having to type choices in.
    - Or—at the very least—I wish to make the game run as if it is a single window with text changing instead of it just printing out so much text that the previous text goes off screen. This would be preferrable.
- Possibly use something like Ratatui: <https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui>
